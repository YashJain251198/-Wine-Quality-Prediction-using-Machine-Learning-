I recently completed a detailed project analyzing the Wine Quality Dataset (1599 samples, 12 features) where I performed:   ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key factors affecting wine quality.   ✅ Feature engineering and scaling.   ✅ Machine learning model building (Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest).
