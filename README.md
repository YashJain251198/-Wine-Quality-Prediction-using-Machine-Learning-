# -Wine-Quality-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-
I recently completed a detailed project analyzing the Wine Quality Dataset (1599 samples, 12 features) where I performed:
âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key factors affecting wine quality.   
âœ… Feature engineering and scaling.   
âœ… Machine learning model building (Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest).
âœ… Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, achieving ~88% accuracy with Random Forest.
âœ… Feature importance analysis (Alcohol, Sulphates, and Volatile Acidity emerged as the most significant features).
âœ… Handling class imbalance using SMOTE for better recall on minority class wines.

ðŸ“Œ Tech stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SMOTE.

This project strengthened my understanding of data preprocessing, model selection, and performance optimization in real-world classification problems.
